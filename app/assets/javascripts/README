About the scripts
=======================

history.js
  A library to make HTML5 window.history work better, and also fallback
  gracefully for HTML4 browsers. It is a little heavyweight, and includes
  a bunch of features we don't need -- like storing data with history.

prototype.js
  core additions to javascript. included in prototype directory are the
  scriptaculous effects for prototype that we also use.


IE9.js
  makes all versions of IE behave pretty close to IE9


Using scripts
=========================

The optional scripts are loaded like so:

  class MyController < ApplicationController
    javascript :tasks, :wiki
    javascript :extra, :action => :index
  end


Production
======================

rake cg:compile_assets

  compiles these javascript files and puts them in public/static


About Rails 2 integration
==============================

We use the sprockets asset pipeline for javascript. Sprockets is included
by default in rails 3, but some changes need to be made to make it work with
rails 2. 

In order to use sprockets with rails 2, we follow this:

  http://pivotallabs.com/users/dwfrank/blog/articles/1972-giving-rails-2-the-asset-pipeline-

With some changes:

  * We don't use /assets/ for sprockets generated assets, because crabgrass already uses
    that route for other things.
  * We had to create a custome rake task to compile the assets.
