  CONTEXT BANNER

  This is the only place that should hold banner view code.
  it used to be in a dozen places, now it is here, and here alone.

  the purpose of the banner is to provide a very strong visual and nav context.

  if the current page is a blog posting, for example, i want it to be clear is
  is *my* blog posting. if a page is owned by a group, i want to quickly figure
  this out.

  however, sometimes it makes sense to not have a banner at all. For example
  when a page doesn't have an owner. Directories should not have banners,
  because there is now user or group context.

  eventually, we want the user to be able to personally customize the appearance
  of their context banner, as well as the navigation and links.

- if visible_context?
  %header#context_banner
    %div#banner_content
      = render @context.banner_partial
      = render '/layouts/context/nav/banner_menu'
