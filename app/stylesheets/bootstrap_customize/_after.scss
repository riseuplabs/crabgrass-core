// The default display for bootstrap's .pagination is line-block.

// I am not sure what the advantage of inline-block was.
// Setting this to block allows margins to collapse nicely, but the
// clearfix is needed because of all the floats on the li elements.

// This hack seems to work reliably in firefox and chrome. Not
