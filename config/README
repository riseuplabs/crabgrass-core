these still need a place:
===================================

# uncomment this to print out what the hell the processors are doing.
# Media::Process::Base.log_to_stdout_when = :always

AssetExtension::Storage.make_required_dirs


THINGS TO CONFIGURE
==================================

There are three files that need to be configured for crabgrass:

  * config/crabgrass/secret.txt  (rake make_a_secret)
  * config/database.yml
  * config/crabgrass/crabgrass.[production|development|test].yml

There are many levels of possible defaults for configuration options.
In order of precedence, crabgrass will search:

   (1) the current site
   (2) the default site (if a site has default == true)
   (3) options configured in the file config/crabgrass.*.yml
   (4) last-stop hardcoded defaults in lib/crabgrass/conf.rb

RAILS INITIALIZATION PROCESS
======================================

  1. framework

  4. plugins 
     alpha order of everything in vendor/plugins, vendor/crabgrass_plugins,
     extensions/mods, and extensions/pages.

  5. gems

  6. initializers
     config/initalizers/*.rb

  7. view paths
