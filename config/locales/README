TRANSIFEX
------------------------
To handle translations, we are using a system called Transifex. On transifex, the crabgrass home page is here:
https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/crabgrass/
To upload a new English source file using the web interface, go to 'Resources' -> 'master' -> 'Edit resource'
In the screen to edit the resource, you can upload a new source file.
We will upload just the en.yml as a resource, which is generated from the different English files. The en.yml file should not be edited directly, as then changes will be lost when somebody generates it again.

There is transifex documentation at http://help.transifex.net/intro/getting-started.html
and the Transifix API:
http://help.transifex.net/features/api/api-v2.1.html

There is a rake task to pull translations for the enabled languages. This can be run with:
rake cg:i18n:download
For this task to work, you must set the transifex password in the appropriate config/crabgrass/crabgrass.{environment}.yml file.

Some more specific documentation:
To get out translated files, we can download them from the website.
curl -L --user {user}:{pass} -X GET https://www.transifex.net/api/2/project/crabgrass/resource/master/translation/{language-to-get}/?file

to get stats:
curl -L --user {user}:{pass} -X GET https://www.transifex.net/api/2/project/crabgrass/resource/master/stats/

It would be nice to upload new source files, but I haven't gotten that to work right. I was hoping something like this would work, but it does not:
 curl -L --user {user}:{pass} -X  PUT -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" --upload-file "config/locales/en.yml" https://www.transifex.net/api/2/project/crabgrass/resource/master/content 

We can also explore using the transifix client:
