# 'destroy' should be reserved for when the action has consequence, like destroying a group.
#  alternately, maybe 'destroy' should be for actions that cannot be undone.
# 'delete' should be used otherwise, like deleting a request.
# 'remove' is different. You remove a user from a group, or a user from your contacts.
