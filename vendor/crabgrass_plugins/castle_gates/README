CASTLE GATES -- model permissions for active record

Castle Gates provides access control to models using efficient database bitfields.

Castle Gates is more complicated than most model permissions systems. It is designed for
a usage scenario where a user might have many different possible permission pathways
and you want to resolve these quickly to determine if they have access to a particular
resource. For example, a user might have access because they have been granted access
directly, or they are in a group that was granted access, or they are a friend of someone
who has granted access to 'friends'.

A very simple example:

  class Fort
  end

  class User
  end

  CasteGates.define do
    castle Fort do
      gate 1, :front_door
    end
    holder 1, :user, :model => User
  end

  fort = Fort.create!
  user = User.create!

  fort.access?(user => :front_door)      ==> false
  fort.grant_access!(user => :front_door)
  fort.access?(user => :front_door)      ==> true

Limitations

Castle Gates is fast, but because of its implementation, every castle is limited
to a finite number of doors (the number of bits in the door_bitmask field,
typically 32, see below).

Furthermore, your application cannot have more than 9 different types of key holders.

Concepts
================================================

Castles:

  * A castle is a model with something you want to control access to.
  * Every castle has one or more gates.

Gates:

  * A gate is just a symbol (e.g. :front_door).
  * A gate is some resource you want to protect in the castle (e.g. :editable)
  * Since gates are just symbols, they don't relate to actual fields of the castle.

Keys:

  * Keys are ActiveRecord models stored in the database in the table 'castle_gates_keys'.
  * A key instance has a set of gates it will open for a particular castle.
  * Castles have many keys, one for each holder with access to any of its gates.

Holders:

  * A holder is something that can own keys that open gates.
  * A holder has many keys, one for each castle the holder has some access to.
  * A holder might be a record, like a user or group, but it could also be
    an association or a symbol.

Although there is only one key for a single caste <=> holder relationship,
in practice an object might have many holders associated with it.

For example, a user might be associated with a key holder for each group
they are in. In this case, the user might have many keys for a particular
castle, each key with access to different gates.

If any of the keys grant access to a gate, then the user has access to the
gate. In other words, the user always tries all the possible keys until
one works or they are denied access.

Castle Gates is very flexible, but has a few important limitation:

  (1) The number of gates a castle can have is limited to the bit
      length of castle_gates_keys.gate_bitfield

  (2) System-wide, there can only be nine types of holders.


Installation

Optional configuration:

  CastleGate.exception_class = PermissionDenied

Usage
================================================

To be written.

Usage Example
================================================

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :clans, :through => :memberships
end

class Clan < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :memberships
  has_many :users, :through => :memberships
end

class Membership < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :clan
end

class Fort < ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Permissions < CastleGates::Permissions do

  castle Fort do
    gate 1, :draw_bridge
    gate 2, :sewers, :default_open => :admin
    gate 3, :tunnel, :default_open => [:public, :user]
  end

  castle Tower do
    gate 1, :door, :default_open => true
    gate 2, :window
    def after_grant_access(holder, gates)
      if holder == :public
        grant_access! :admin => gates
      end
    end
    def after_revoke_access(holder, gates)
      if holder == :admin
        revoke_access! :public => gates
      end
    end
  end

  holder 1, :user, :model => User do
    def holder_codes
      {:holder => :clan, :ids => self.clan_ids}
    end
  end

  holder 2, :clan,  :model => Clan
  holder 3, :public
  holder 4, :admin
end

Testing
================================================

Because of the way that CastleGates caches keys, you must call clear_key_cache()
on the castle class in the setup() or teardown() of your unit tests:

For example:

  class GroupTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
    def teardown
      Group.clear_key_cache
    end
  end


The Database
================================================

Schema:

  create_table :keys do |p|
    p.integer :castle_id
    p.string  :castle_type
    p.integer :holder_code
    p.integer :gate_bitfield, :default => 1
  end
  add_index :keys, [:castle_id, :castle_type, :holder_code]

Field explanation:

  castle_id, castle_type -- polymorphic 'belongs_to :castle'.

  holder_code -- a code that defines the holder of this key. it is kind of like a
    polymorphic belongs_to, except that the holder does not need to be an actual
    record. It could be an abstract set, like 'users with names that start with z'

  gate_bitfield -- a bitfield that defines which gates of the castle this key
    will open. For example, if the bits in positions '3' and '5' are set to '1',
    then the key grants the holder access to the gates with id '3' and '5'.
    The default is 1 because this enables us to quickly distinguish between when
    there are no keys and when the keys don't allow access.

If you want a bigger gate_bitfield (to store more than 32 doors in a key),
change the migration like so (MySQL specific):

   p.column :gate_bitfield, 'BIGINT', :default => 1

In MySQL, INT is 4 bytes, BIGINT is 8 bytes (64 doors).
