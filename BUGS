destroying groups
  needs a lot of work
  what to do with orphaned pages?
  all the pages that have cached the owner_name should get cleared out.
    (or maybe not, instead link to 'anonymous'?)
  what about everywhere else? create GroupGhost with the same id but with no content?

when notices are rendered as pages, they still fade.

i18n blows up if the session language is set to swedish.

alert messages don't stack for modalbox

confirmation before destroy contact

page search:
  should be 'watching' instead of 'watched'
  once active, needs to indicate i clicked on 'my pages -> own'.
  need ajaxy history

the split panel is not something that we should keep, unless it can
  be made to work when the screen gets small.

  need history

pages:
  need 'show print' option.
